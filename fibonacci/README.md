<h1>The Fibonacci Function</h1>
By the Fibonacci Function, I mean that function defined on the natural numbers, N, whose value at n is the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence as defined on the following Wikipedia page.

* Fibonacci Function

Each number in that sequence is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. Hence, using a recursive definition, we have

Fib:N -> N+, with Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1) = 1, and for n > 1, Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)
