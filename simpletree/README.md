<h1>A Simple Binary Tree Example</h1>
This subproject is an example of using recursive programming to define, initialize, and print, in various ways, a binary tree.   
The tree is created in such a way that it is mostly balanced, and a depth-first search to print the data will print it sorted least to largest value.

<h2>Usage</h2>

````
usage: simpletree.py [-h] [--max MAX] [--use_debug_problem] n  

Creates a binary tree with n nodes with values 0 through n-1. If max is specified then n values are chosen
randomly between 0 and max-1 inclusive.  

positional arguments:  
 
    n                   number of nodes  

optional arguments:  
 
   -h, --help           show this help message and exit  
  
   --max MAX            maximum value for nodes  
  
   --use_debug_problem  use a special problem for debugging
