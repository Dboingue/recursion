usage: simpletree.py [-h] [--max MAX] [--use_debug_problem] n

Creates a binary tree with n nodes with values 0 through n-1. If max is
specified then n values are chosen randomly between 0 and max-1 inclusive.

positional arguments:
  n                    number of nodes

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --max MAX            maximum value for nodes
  --use_debug_problem  use a special problem for debugging

>python simpletree.py -1
error: n must be greater than 0.

>python simpletree.py 0
error: n must be greater than 0.

>python simpletree.py --max 20 30
error: max must be at least n = 30
